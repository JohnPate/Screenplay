LaTeX2e class to provide formatting for Draft Screenplays as
recommended by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

Potential users need to read the information from the Academy, a
few example scripts, and draw their own conclusions.  I believe
`screenplay.cls' will produce a fair copy for the Nicholl
Fellowships Competition - if you do your part.

screenplay.zip should contain...

* README	 - this file 
* screenplay.dtx - the source file 
* screenplay.ins - driver file
* screenplay.pdf - documentation - read it
* test.pdf	 - format test output
* COPYING	 - GNU General Public License

If not, get the latest version via...
	http://dvc.org.uk/sacrific.txt/screenplay.zip

Enjoy.
